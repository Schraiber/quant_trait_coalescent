# quant_trait_coalescent

This R package simulates quantitative traits under simple scenarios, allowing the coalescent process, the mutational kernel that determines the effect sizes from mutation events, and mutational targets (loci).

Additionally, the package provides tools to characterize the resulting quantitative trait distributions, with particular interest paid to robust moment estimation (variance, skewness, and kurtosis estimators), non-normality tests, and non-unimodality tests.
